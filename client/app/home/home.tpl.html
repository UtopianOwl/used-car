            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Well, I'll tell you what we don't do. We don't take in any old, beat up, clunker or junker. We select only those vehicles of acceptable quality (our mechanics have to do <span class="italic">something</span>) whose design, build, and overall engineering have stood the test of time.</p>
            <p>You see here at Kyle's we will do more than just sell you a great car. We are passionate about cherishing and preserving great american automobiles, and we will be there with you to help cherish and preserve yours long after you drive it out of the lot. Thats the way Kyle dit it...</p>
